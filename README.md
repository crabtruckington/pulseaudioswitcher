# pulseaudioswitcher

This ruby script will allow you to switch between two pulseaudio devices, and plays a beep through the new device so you can tell which one has been activated. Ideal if you have headphones and speakers always plugged in. Hotkey the script.

If you have more than 2 devices, it will only switch between device 1 and device 2. Extend the script, or remove devices.
